## Introduction
In this project, we demonstrate how to set up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and Kubernetes. Jenkins is a popular open-source automation server, while Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Kubernetes cluster
- Jenkins installed in the Kubernetes cluster
- Docker
- Python (since the project is primarily written in Python)

## Setup
To set up the CI/CD pipeline, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rabbitglauser/Kubernetes-based-CI-CD-Pipeline.git
    cd Kubernetes-based-CI-CD-Pipeline
    ```

2. **Set up Jenkins**:
   - Deploy Jenkins on your Kubernetes cluster using Helm or other methods.
   - Configure Jenkins with necessary plugins and credentials.

3. **Configure the pipeline**:
   - Create a Jenkinsfile in the repository that defines the stages of the pipeline.
   - Set up Jenkins to use this Jenkinsfile for building, testing, and deploying the application.

## Usage
To use the pipeline, push your code changes to the repository. Jenkins will automatically trigger the pipeline, which includes the following stages:
1. **Build**: Build the application using Docker.
2. **Test**: Run unit tests and integration tests.
3. **Deploy**: Deploy the application to the Kubernetes cluster.
